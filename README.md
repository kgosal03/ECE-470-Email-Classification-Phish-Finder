# ECE 470 â€“ Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains my coursework for **ECE 470: Artificial Intelligence**, taken at the University of Victoria.

## Overview

In this course, students learn the fundamental principles and techniques of Artificial Intelligence, including:

- Intelligent agents and problem-solving
- Uninformed and informed search algorithms
- Adversarial search (e.g., minimax)
- Logic and knowledge representation
- Reasoning under uncertainty (e.g., Bayesian networks)
- Basics of machine learning

The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation through programming assignments and projects.
